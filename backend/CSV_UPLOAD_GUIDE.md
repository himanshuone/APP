## üìã Question Types

### 1. MCQ (Multiple Choice Question)
- **Single correct answer**
- Must have at least 2 options
- Exactly one option should be marked as correct

Example:
```csv
"What is 2+2?",MCQ,Mathematics,Arithmetic,"3",false,"4",true,"5",false,"6",false,1,0.33,"Simple addition"
```

### 2. MSQ (Multiple Select Question)  
- **Multiple correct answers**
- Must have at least 2 options
- Can have multiple options marked as correct

Example:
```csv
"Which are programming languages?",MSQ,Computer Science,Programming,"Java",true,"HTML",false,"Python",true,"CSS",false,2,0.66,"Java and Python are programming languages"
```

### 3. NAT (Numerical Answer Type)
- **Numerical answer only**
- No options needed (leave option fields empty)
- Answer goes in correct_answer field

Example:
```csv
"What is 25 + 15?",NAT,Mathematics,Arithmetic,"","","","","","","","",1,0,"Simple addition"
```

## ‚úÖ Sample CSV File

```csv
question_text,question_type,subject,topic,option_1,option_1_correct,option_2,option_2_correct,option_3,option_3_correct,option_4,option_4_correct,marks,negative_marks,explanation
"What is the time complexity of binary search?",MCQ,Computer Science,Algorithms,"O(n)",false,"O(log n)",true,"O(n¬≤)",false,"O(1)",false,2,0.66,"Binary search divides search space in half"
"Which data structure follows LIFO?",MCQ,Computer Science,Data Structures,"Queue",false,"Stack",true,"Array",false,"Tree",false,1,0.33,"Stack follows Last In First Out principle"
"Which are sorting algorithms?",MSQ,Computer Science,Algorithms,"Bubble Sort",true,"Binary Search",false,"Quick Sort",true,"Linear Search",false,2,0.66,"Bubble Sort and Quick Sort are sorting algorithms"
"What is 25 + 15?",NAT,Mathematics,Arithmetic,"","","","","","","","",1,0,"Simple addition: 25 + 15 = 40"
"Find the square root of 64",NAT,Mathematics,Arithmetic,"","","","","","","","",1,0.33,"‚àö64 = 8"
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. **CSV Parsing Errors**
- **Issue**: Commas in question text break parsing
- **Solution**: Wrap text with commas in double quotes
```csv
"In C++, what does the operator ',' do?",MCQ,...
```

### 2. **Question Type Errors** 
- **Issue**: Invalid question type
- **Solution**: Use exactly: MCQ, MSQ, or NAT (case-insensitive)

### 3. **Missing Required Fields**
- **Issue**: Empty question_text, subject, or topic
- **Solution**: Ensure all required fields have values

### 4. **Option Validation Errors**
- **Issue**: MCQ with no correct answers or multiple correct answers
- **Solution**: MCQ must have exactly one correct answer, MSQ can have multiple

### 5. **Authentication Errors**
- **Issue**: "Could not validate credentials"
- **Solution**: Ensure you're logged in as admin user

## üì§ How to Upload

### Via Web Interface
1. Login as admin user
2. Go to Admin Panel ‚Üí Upload Questions
3. Select your CSV file
4. Click Upload

### Via API (curl)

TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"password"}' | \
  jq -r '.access_token')

# Upload CSV
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/admin/upload/csv \

  -F "file=@your_questions.csv"
```

## üîç Validation Process

The system validates each row and will:
1. ‚úÖ **Accept valid questions** and add them to database
2. ‚ùå **Skip invalid rows** and report errors
3. üìä **Return summary** with count of successful uploads and any errors

Example Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Successfully added 3 questions",
  "errors": [
    "Row 2: Invalid question type: INVALID",
    "Row 4: Question text is required"
  ]
}
```

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with 2-3 questions first
2. **Use Templates**: Copy the sample CSV format exactly
3. **Validate Data**: Check your CSV in a text editor before upload
4. **Backup**: Keep a backup of your question data
5. **Test Questions**: Review uploaded questions in the admin panel
